The game allows users to choose between stone, paper and scissors to play against the computer, with score tracking and real-time results display.

# Install pyInstaller for .exe 
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
renitialize the main.exe file (if of course it does not work after installing pyInstaller). 

You will need to use the command 
```
pyinstaller main.spec
```
